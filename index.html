        <p>Take off and landing</p>

        <p>Ever wondered how to take off in a big commercial jet? I know I have, so I'll tell you how to.</p>
        <p>so in the cockpit you have a yolk or a side stick, and if you are the main pilot then you'll also have control over the thrust levers, which are the big white levers to the right if you are the main pilot.</p>
        <p>While you are taking off it is crucial to make sure these things are set, Flaps should be at around 15 degreese, your thrust should be at around 85% while taking off, and you it is crucial you can see your PFD (Primary Flight Display).</p>
        <p>So now you are onn the runway and you want to take off, well set flasp to 15 degreese, thrust 85%, and you can see your PFD. So you are flying down the runway, when you hit 155 airspeed (knots) that's when you rotate/ Take off, to take off you need to pull towards you slightly with you yolk or stick.</p>
